# CompactFlightPanel
This Panel should be helpful to use things like the G1000 with a little help by [MobiFlight](https://www.mobiflight.com/) in Sims like MSFS or X-Plane.

Things to be implemented:
- inner NAV-knob with push
- outer NAV-knob
- NAV-changer switch (maybe in outer NAV-knob?)
- Heading-knob with push
- inner ALT-knob
- outer ALT-knob
- inner COM-knob with push
- outer COM-knob
- COM-changer switch (maybe in outer NAV-knob?)
- CRS-knob with push
- BARO-knob
- RANGE-knob
- inner FMS-knob with push
- outer FMS-knob

simple switches might be:
- direct-to
- Menu
- FPL
- Proc
- CLR
- ENT

and for the Autopilot:
- AP
- FD
- HDG
- ALT
- NAV
- VNV
- APR
- BC
- VS
- FLC
- Nose up
- Nose down


Parts to be used might be like:
- Rotary Encoders
  - KY-040 (single) (front-plate mountable)
  - EC11EBB24C03 (dual, front-plate mountable)
- Momentary switches
  - KD2 (might be too large, front-plate mountable)
  - Keyboard-Switch, like Gateron Pro V2 (front-plate mountable)
  - or some other kind of microswitch with a long knob (board-mounted, board reverse-mounted to the frontplate, knob-thru-hole in frontlpate)

Goal should be a 3D-printed case, easy to mount knobs and switches, a magical wiring, a microchip, USB-connection to a PC and Configfiles f√ºr Mobiflight.
